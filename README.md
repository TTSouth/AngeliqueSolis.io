# Angelique Solis Model Example Website

  This is one of my first websites that I created on my own to practice HTML and CSS. I got my inspiration from a wordpress template that I came across. This website is one of three model websites that I created that week. This is the original so it does need some clean up.

  ## The Website Template Explained

  I designed a template to use for each page so that I can copy it over to each page. I have used Figma to create a visual example to show the layout. 
  You can view it here

  The template consists of many divs to split up the content and to create containers within containers for design purposes. The background is done in the stylesheet. 
  You can view the template page in the main section of the repository.
  
  - The div class Parent contains all of the websites content from the Mainer Header to the copyright footer.
  - The div class Parent contains all of the websites content from the Mainer Header to the copyright footer.
  - Header contains the banner logo.
  - BgContainer contains the TitleBox with the page's title to the copyright footer.
  - MainNav contains the main menu to navigate through site.
  - ParentContainer holds the Main Content of site. One borders around the TitleBox and the other borders around the Main.
  - BxContainer is inside the ParentContainer and creates a lighter design around the BorderContainer of the TitleBox around the Main content.
  - TitleBox containers a dark flowery design the title of each page
