# Angelique Solis Model Example Website

This is one of my first websites that I created on my own to practice HTML and CSS. I got my inspiration from a wordpress template that I came across. This website is one of three model websites that I created that week. This is the original so it does need some clean up.

## Technologies

I used HTML and pure CSS to build this website.

I practiced CSS to create a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly website. Key features of the CSS implementation include:

  - ![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Global_Styling-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=purple) : Applied universal selectors to normalize styles across browsers, ensuring consistency in elements like margins, padding, and box-sizing.


  - ![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fixed_and_Rotated_Elements-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=purple) : Created visually striking elements like a fixed, rotated .cardBooking button to enhance user engagement and interaction.


  - ![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Custom_Navigation-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=purple) : Designed a custom navigation bar with hover effects, leveraging CSS transitions for smooth animations.


 - ![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Content_Layouts-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=purple) : Structured complex content sections using flexbox for alignment and grid systems to maintain balance across the page.


 - ![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hover_Effects-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=purple) : Implemented interactive hover effects for images and buttons, providing feedback to users through color changes and animations.


 - ![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Theming_and_Aesthetic-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=purple) : Selected a dark theme with accent colors, utilizing background images and color overlays to maintain a cohesive visual style.

 
 - ![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Form_Styling-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=purple) : Enhanced form elements with customized styles for validation, borders, and input focus, contributing to a polished user experience.


This approach allowed me to gain hands-on experience with both fundamental and advanced CSS techniques, honing my skills in web design and responsiveness.


It also uses lists for navigation in the main menu and in multiple columns in the footer section. CSS flexbox was used to build the layout and assist in the responsiveness of the webpage.
